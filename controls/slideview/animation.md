# Animation

Telerik for .NET MAUI SlideView allows you to configure the animation that appears when the user slides between the views.

SlideView provides the following properties that control the animation:

* `AnimationEasing`(`Easing`)&mdash;Defines the `Microsoft.Maui.Easing` of the animation that runs when the current index changes.

* `AnimationDuration`(`int`)&mdash;Defines the duration (in milliseconds) of the animation that runs when the current index changes.
