# .NET MAUI SlideView Navigation Buttons

To switch through the different views of the SlideView, you van use Navigation Buttons. On `WinUI` and `MacCatalyst` the buttons are visible by default. On `Android` and `iOS` the buttons are hidden.

The SlideView exposes a `NavigationButtonVisibility` property that allows you to control the visibility options of the Navigation Buttons:

* `Visible`&mdash;The buttons are visible. 

* `HiddenWhenDisabled`&mdash;The buttons are visible when enabled and hidden when disabled.

* `Collapsed`&mdash;The buttons are not visible.
