# .NET MAUI GridSplitter Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI GridSplitter is a control, which allows the redistribution of space between columns or rows in a Grid. By dragging the splitter, users can resize the target columns or rows to better fit the content.

The GridSplitter control automatically detects the target columns or rows to resize. As you drag the control, it begins resizing and redistributing space between them. You can specify whether the GridSplitter resizes rows or columns, as well as which columns or rows are adjusted relative to the GridSplitter's defined position.

You can define the GridSplitter to be located within its own row (for horizontal GridSPlitter) or column (for a vertical GridSplitter). You can also place the GridsPlitter control to the following positions:
* In a cell with another control.
* As a last element in the Grid, in order to position the GridSplitter on top of the control that the GridSplitter shares a cell with.
