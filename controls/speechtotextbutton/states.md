# .NET MAUI SpeechToTextButton Architecture and States

The SpeechTextButton control handles user interactions and provides visual feedback about its current state, for example, when it's listening or ready. The button uses a speech recognition service that varies by platform and also provides an AI agent connection. Almost all operations are asynchronous.
