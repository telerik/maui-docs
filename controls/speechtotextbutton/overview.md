# .NET MAUI SpeechToTextButton Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI SpeechToTextButton is a UI component that enables users to convert spoken words into text within .NET MAUI applications.

When the user taps the button, the control uses a speech recognition service, listens for voice input, and then transcribes the recognized speech into text. The recognized text can be displayed in a text field or used for further processing in your application.
