# .NET MAUI BottomSheet Events

The .NET MAUI BottomSheet exposes the `PositionChanged` event which is raised when the position of the bottom sheet changes. 
The `PositionChanged` event handler receives two parameters: 
* The `sender` argument which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadBottomSheet` type.
* The `BottomSheetPositionChangedEventArgs` object which has a reference to the new position of the bottom sheet through its `Position`(of type `double`) property.
