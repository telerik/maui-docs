# .NET MAUI BottomSheet Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI BottomSheet is a UI component that slides up from the bottom of the screen to reveal more content. Use the BottomSheet to display additional information, provide the user with actions or give the option for secondary navigation. 

The control presents the information or actions related to the current screen but it does not cover the full screen.
