# .NET MAUI BottomSheet Swiping

The BottomSheet control for .NET MAUI allows you to use the swipe gesture for opening the sheet view.

You can disable the swipe gesture by setting the `IsSwipeEnabled` (`bool`) property. The default value is `true`.

> For a runnable example with the BottomSheet Swipe scenario, see the [SDKBrowser Demo Application]({%slug sdkbrowser-app%}) and go to **BottomSheet > Features** category.
