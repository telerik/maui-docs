# .NET MAUI CollectionView Overview

The Telerik .NET MAUI CollectionView is a virtualizing view component that provides features associated with scenarios where a list of items is used. The control gives you the option to filter, sort and group the items. Also you can take advantage of the flexible styling API and the exposed templates for customization.

## Key Features

* [Data Binding]({%slug collectionview-data-binding%})&mdash; The CollectionView for .NET MAUI component supports data binding in the form of a path property.

* [Item Appearance]({%slug collectionview-data-binding%}#define-item-appearance)&mdash;CollectionView allows you to adjust the appearance of its items. You can also apply different appearances to each item based on a specific condition.

* Various layouts and orientations&mdash;You can choose between the [linear]({%slug collectionview-linear-layout%}) and [grid]({%slug collectionview-grid-layout%}) layouts. In addition, the CollectionView supports vertical and horizontal orientation for the exposed layouts. The orientation of the control allows you to scroll the items vertically or horizontally.

* [Grouping]({%slug collectionview-grouping%})&mdash;You can group the items by using the exposed properties. In addition, you can apply multi-level (nested) grouping.

* [Group headers]({%slug collectionview-group-header%})&mdash;While grouping the items in the CollectionView, group header is visualized. In addition, you can customize its appearance by using a template.

* [Sorting]({%slug collectionview-sorting%})&mdash;CollectionView allows you to sort the data based on your criteria.

* [Filtering]({%slug collectionview-filtering%})&mdash;You can filter the items in the CollectionView by using the exposed filter descriptors.

* [Item Swipe]({%slug collectionview-item-swipe-overview%})&mdash;When users swipe, the CollectionView can reveal a designated custom view with actionable content.

* [Drag &amp; Drop]({%slug collectionview-dragdrop-overview%})&mdash;The .NET MAUI CollectionView provides drag-and-drop functionality which allows the end user to reorder its items as well as drag and drop items between two CollectionViews.

* [Load on Demand]({%slug collectionview-load-on-demand%})&mdash;In addition to the built-in UI virtualization, the CollectionView supports a load-on-demand functionality, which optimizes the initial loading of the application.

To take advantage of the conditional styling feature provided by the CollectionView, you can use the [style selector]({%slug collectionview-itemstyle-selector%}).

* [Empty template]({%slug collectionview-empty-template%})&mdash;When the `ItemsSource` is null or the collection is empty, you can specify a template that provides user feedback.
