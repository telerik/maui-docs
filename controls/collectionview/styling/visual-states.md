# .NET MAUI CollectionView Visual States

This article describes the visual states provided by the CollectionView control. You can use these visual states to change the appearance of the control based on its state—such as when it’s disabled, focused, hovered, and more.

The CollectionView provides the following `CommonStates` visual states:

| Visual State | Description |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| `Normal` | Applies when the item is in its normal state. |
| `Selected` | Applies when the item is selected&mdash;for `Single` or `Multiple` `SelectionMode`. |
| `MouseOver` | Applies when the mouse cursor is hovering over the item. |
| `Focused` | Applies when setting the current item. |
| `FocusedMouseOver` | Applies when the current item is set and the mouse cursor is hovering it. |
| `FocusedSelected` | Applies when the item is selected and focused. |
| `Disabled` | Applies when the ColelctionView item `IsEnabled` is `False`. |
