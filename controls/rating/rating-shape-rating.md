# .NET MAUI Shape Rating

The `RadShapeRating` component is designed for the simplest scenarios where an ordinary Rating component is required. `RadShapeRating` allows easy customization of the colors and shape of the default rating item.

## Shape Types

`RadShapeRating` exposes the `ItemShape` property of type `RadPathGeometry` which is used to define the shape of the rating items.

For a simple and fast setup, the Rating includes various simple shapes that can be used for rating items out of the box. This is accomplished through the `RadGeometry` class. The `RadGeometry` class exposes static properties that return predefined shapes.

>tip For more details on `RadPath` and `RadPathGeometry`, refer to the [Path Overview article]({%slug path-overview%}).

## Geometries

The Rating supports the following geometry types:

## Shapes Styling

You can control the visual appearance of the predefined shapes through the following styling settings:

* `ItemFill` (`Color`)&mdash;Specifies the color used to fill the rating item.
* `ItemStroke` (`Color`)&mdash;Defines the color used by the border around the geometry.
* `ItemStrokeThickness` (`double`)&mdash;Sets the width of the border around the geometry.
* `SelectedItemFill` (`Color`)&mdash;Defines the color used to fill the selected rating item.
* `SelectedItemStroke` (`Color`)&mdash;Sets the color used by the border around the selected geometry.
* `SelectedItemStrokeThickness` (`double`)&mdash;Specifies the width of the border around the selected geometry.
