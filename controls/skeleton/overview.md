# .NET MAUI Skeleton Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Skeleton control is a UI element that serves as a placeholder while content is being loaded. It provides a visual representation of the layout and structure of the content that will eventually be displayed, helping to improve the user experience during loading times.

The animation of the skeleton indicates that the content is in the process of loading, which can help to reduce perceived wait times and keep users engaged. In addition, you can use the built-in skeletons and to apply a custom one to match the skeleton's appearance to your application's design.
