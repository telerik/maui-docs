# Configuration

By using the exposed configuration options of the [.NET MAUI RichTextEditor]({%slug richtexteditor-overview%}), you can configure the component features, such as the HTML source, text formatting options, text selections, and the read-only mode.

## HTML Source Options

To load HTML content from a string or a stream into the editor, use the `Source` property of type `RichTextSource`. 

You can directly assign a string (containing HTML) as a <code>Source</code> of the editor and `RadRichTextEditor` will display the HTML content through the implicit converter implemented in `RichTextSource`.

```C#
this.richTextEditor.Source = "<b>Hello World!</b>";
```

### Load HTML from a String

You can load the HTML content from a string by using the static <code>FromString</code> method of the `RichTextSource` class and assign the result to the `Source` property of `RadRichTextEditor`:

<snippet id='richtexteditor-getting-started' />

Alternatively, you can create a [`RichTextHtmlStringSource`](/devtools/maui/api/telerik.maui.controls.richtexteditor.richtexthtmlstringsource) object and assign it to the <code>Source</code> property of the RichTextEditor.

### Load HTML from a Stream

Another option to preload HTML is by retrieving it from a stream through the static <code>FromStream</code> method of the `RichTextSource` and again, assign the result to the `Source` property of the RichTextEditor. In the example below, the HTML file is loaded as an `EmbeddedResource`.

<snippet id='richtexteditor-keyfeatures-fromstream' />

Alternatively, you can create a [`RichTextHtmlStreamSource`](/devtools/maui/api/telerik.maui.controls.richtexteditor.richtexthtmlstreamsource) object and set it as the <code>Source</code> of the RichTextEditor.

## Retrieving HTML Content

Through `GetHtmlAsync` method of RichTextEditor, you can get the content created and updated inside the editor HTML:

<snippet id='richtexteditor-keyfeatures-gethtml' />

The next image shows the result from the sample code with `GetHtmlAsync`.

## RichTextEditor Editing Capabilities

RichTextEditor helps the app users to create and edit HTML content. You can apply the editing features provided by RichTextEditor through the UI by using the[`RadRichTextEditorToolbar`]({%slug richtexteditor-toolbar %}), or you can create your custom UI and manually execute the `RadRichTextEditor` [Commands]({%slug richtexteditor-commands%}).

In addition, RichTextEditor provides a flexible API that allows you to apply formatting at the current caret position or on the selected text inside the editing area.

| Formating Options | Descriptions |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| `TextFormatting` of type `RichTextFormatting` | Defines the text formatting, such as heading, paragraph or quotation of the text at the current position or selection |
| `TextColor` | Specifies the color of the text at the current position or selection |
| `HighlightTextColor` | Defines the text background color at the current position or selection |
| `SelectionRange` of type `RichTextSelectionRange` | Specifies the start and end position of the currently selected inside the editor text |
| `FontSize` | Sets the font size of the text at the current caret position or selection |
| `FontAttributes` of type `RichTextFontAttributes` | Defines the font attributes, such as bold, italic, subscript, and superscript at the current position or selection |
| `TextDecorations` of type `RichTextDecorations` | Specifies text decorations, such as underline and strikethrough at the current position or selection |
| `HorizontalTextAlignment` of type `RichTextHorizontalAlignment` | Specifies the text alignment, such as left, right, center, or justify at the current position or selection |
| `ListType` of type `RichTextListType` | Specifies the list type, such as numbered or bulleted list at the current position or selection |

## Text Selection

RichTextEditor has a text selection functionality—the end user can initiate a selection action through the tap and hold gesture over the text. The selected text is marked with a different background color and two drag handles are available to the user to make it easier to modify the current selection. 

* `GetSelectionAsync` method—Asynchronously returns a `RichTextSelection` object which defines the current text selection inside the editor (returns `null` if no text is selected). The <code>RichTextSelection</code> object contains the `Text` itself as well as the `Start` and `End` position of the text characters.
	
## Read-Only State

The `IsReadOnly`(`bool`) property of the RichTextEditor indicates whether the control is in a read-only mode. Setting `IsReadOnly="True"` means that the Toolbar Items will be disabled and the content of the document cannot be changed. By default, the editor is editable and the `IsReadOnly` value is `False`. 

### Read-Only Example

The next example shows how to triggers the `IsReadOnly` state by using a switch. The next snippet shows the XAML definition:

<snippet id='richtexteditor-readonly-state' />

For the example, we use a converter to hide the Toolbar when the control is in read-only state:

<snippet id='richtexteditor-readonly-converter' />

The next code sample shows how to define the source of the RichTextEditor:

<snippet id='richtexteditor-readonly-state-code-behind' />

> The `richtexteditor-htmlsource.html` file is visualized in the Editor as an `EmbeddedResource`.

> For a runnable example with the RichTextEditor read-only state, see the [SDKBrowser Demo Application]({%slug sdkbrowser-app%}) and go to **RichTextEditor > Features**.
