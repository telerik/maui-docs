## Key Features of the .NET MAUI DataForm

* [Built-in editors]({%slug dataform-editors%})&mdash;DataForm provides a set of built-in editors for the available primitive types such as `numeric`, `string`, `boolean`, `enumerations`, `DateTime`, `TimeSpan`. The control detects the types of the data objectâ€™s properties and automatically displays the proper editor.  

* [Custom editors]({%slug dataform-custom-editor%})&mdash;DataForm provides an option for defining custom editors.  

* [Validation support]({%slug dataform-validation%})&mdash;Use the built-in validation support which gives you full control over the data collected through the control.

* [Commit modes]({%slug dataform-commit-data%})&mdash;DataForm provides editing support with three types of commit modes to determine when the edited value have to be synchronized with the business object.

* [Grouping]({%slug dataform-grouping%}) support that allows you to group the editors.

* [Data annotations support]({%slug dataform-data-annotations%})&mdash;To customize the way data is interpreted in DataForm you can use helpers in the form of Data Annotations. Use annotations like `Required`, `DataType`, `Display`, `RegularExpression` and more.

* [Different layouts]({%slug dataform-layouts%})&mdash;Arrange the editors and the groups using different layouts like stack, grid and more.

* [Grouping support]({%slug dataform-grouping%})&mdash;Organize editors in groups for better user experience. Groups can be applied directly in the XAMl, in the ViewModel or in both. 

* [Commands support]({%slug dataform-commands%}) for validation and commit data and canceling the commit operation.

* [Flexible Styling API]({%slug dataform-styling%}) for customizing the look of the DataForm, its Editors, Groups and Headers. In addition you can customize the error and validation messages.

* [Localization support]({%slug globalization-localization%}#localization)&mdash;Translate the text displayed as a validation error message to other languages, so that your application can be adapted to different regions. In addition by using the `DataAnnotations` you can apply localization to the editors `HeaderText` and `Placeholder`.
