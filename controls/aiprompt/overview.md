# .NET MAUI AIPrompt Overview

The .NET MAUI AIPrompt component helps you write input (prompt) instructing the Generative AI to produce the desired response.

The component allows you to interact with the output from the AI and execute a set of predefined commands. Furthermore, the AIPrompt comes with three predefined views—Input, Output, and Commands, as well as the option to define custom views. Users can navigate the views through the AIPrompt's TabView.
