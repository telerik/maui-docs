# .NET MAUI ListPicker Overview

Telerik ListPicker for .NET MAUI allows the user to select an item from a list of items and visualizes that items list inside a popup or a dropdown. The ListPicker control has a number of features which enable you to loop through its items infinitely while scrolling, to customize the dialog appearance and style the items, to define templates for the items, and more.
