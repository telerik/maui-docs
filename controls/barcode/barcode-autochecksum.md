# Auto-Check Sum

By default, the RadBarcode control automatically adds a checksum at the end.

To disable the auto-check sum functionality, set the `AutoCheckSum` property of its Symbology to `false`.  

>When the auto-check sum feature is disabled, you have to manually add a checksum to ensure the reliability of the barcode symbol.
