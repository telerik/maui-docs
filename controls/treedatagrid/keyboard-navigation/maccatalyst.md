# .NET MAUI TreeDataGrid Keyboard Support on MacCatalyst

The [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI TreeDataGrid]({%slug datagrid-overview%}) provides keyboard navigation support on `MacCatalyst`.

While applying part of the keyboard keys, you can also change the current cell behavior of the DataGrid component. For more details, see the article on [setting the .NET MAUI DataGrid cells]({%slug datagrid-current-cell%}).

The following table lists the actions and keyboard combinations that are available in the DataGrid:

| Hotkey Combinations  | Action |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| `Left Arrow` | Focuses the next cell on the left. When using single selection mode, the selection also changes. |
| `Right Arrow` | Focuses the next cell on the right. When using single selection mode, the selection also changes. |
| `Up Arrow` | Focuses the next cell above. When using single selection mode, the selection also changes. |
| `Down Arrow` | Focuses the next cell below. When using single selection mode, the selection also changes. |
| `Fn` + `F2` | Puts the current cell in edit mode. |
| `Enter` | Selects the next or previous row. When the cell is in edit mode, the changes are committed and the next row is selected. |
| `Esc` | Cancels the editing of the current cell. |
| `Tab` | Focuses the next cell. When cell is in edit mode, the next cell editor is focused. |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Focuses the previous cell. When in edit mode, the previous editor is focused. |
| `Command` + `Left Arrow` | Collapses the TreeDataGrid item if item has children. If the item is collapsed, focuses the first cell of the current row. |
| `Command` + `Right Arrow` | Expands the TreeDataGrid item if item has children. If the item is expanded, focuses the last cell of the current row. |
| `Command` + `Up Arrow` | Focuses the first cell of the column where the current cell is presented. |
| `Command` + `Down Arrow` | Focuses the last cell of the column where the current cell is presented. |
| `Fn` + `Left Arrow` | Focuses the first cell of the current row. |
| `Fn` + `Right Arrow` | Focuses the last cell of the current row. |
| `Fn` + `Up Arrow` | Focuses the first cell of the column where the current cell is presented. |
