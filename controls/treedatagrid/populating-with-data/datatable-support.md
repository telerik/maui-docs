# .NET MAUI TreeDataGrid Data Binding: Binding to DataTable

The [.NET MAUI TreeDataGrid]({%slug datagrid-overview%}) provides full and seamless support for all its features in the DataTable.

The component enables you to bind it to the DataTable and you can also add, remove, select, and edit DataGrid items, and update the TreeDataGrid `ItemsSource`. All available TreeDataGrid commands and operations, like filtering, sorting, and selection, are fully functioning when the DataGrid is bound to a DataTable.

## Filtering and Sorting

When using a DataTable, you can filter and sort the data inside the TreeDataGrid through the UI or programmatically.

## CRUD Operations

All CRUD operations, such as adding, removing, and updating the data inside the TreeDataGrid, are supported when the DataGrid is bound to a DataTable.

## Commands

All commands supported by the DataGrid are fully applicable when the component is bound to a DataTable. For the full list, see the article with the [available commands in the TreeDataGrid]({%slug treedatagrid-commands-overview%}).

## Binding When Using a Cell Content Template

When you use a `CellContentTemplate` in the built-in columns and you need to bind a property from the business model to a UI element inside the template, you must use indexer syntax.
