# .NET MAUI DataGrid Events

The [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI DataGrid]({%slug datagrid-overview%}) component exposes a set of events which help users achieve seamless and effective experience when interacting with the component.

## Loading Content on Demand

The load-on-demand feature gets implemented through the `LoadOnDemand` event. The `LoadOnDemand` event handler receives the following parameters:
* The `sender` argument, which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadDataGrid` type.
* A `LoadOnDemandEventArgs` object, which provides the `IsDataLoaded` (`bool`) property, indicating whether the data is loaded.

For more information, see the topic about [loading data on demand in the .NET MAUI DataGrid]({%slug datagrid-features-loadondemand%}).

The following example demonstrates how to use the `LoadOnDemand` event.

**1.** Define the `LoadOnDemand` method in XAML.

<snippet id ='datagrid-loadondemand-event-xaml'/>

**2.** Create the method that defines the functionality of the event.

<snippet id='datagrid-loadondemand-event-csharp'/>

## Loading Distinct Values

The DataGrid enables you to load the distinct values that will be displayed in the `Telerik.Maui.Controls.DataGrid.DataGridDistinctValuesFilterView` through the `DistinctValuesLoading` event. The `DistinctValuesLoading` event handler receives the following parameters:

* The `sender` argument, which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadDataGrid` type.
* A `DistinctValuesLoadingEventArgs` object, which provides the following properties:
	- `DistinctValues`&mdash;Specifies a list of values of type `IEnumerable` which are to be displayed in the `DataGridDistinctValuesFilterView`.
	- (Read-only) `Column` of type `DataGridColumn`&mdash;Gets the column for which the distinct values are being loaded.

For more information, see the topic about the [available filtering options in the .NET MAUI DataGrid]({%slug datagrid-filtering-overview%}).

## Binding to Data

The DataGrid also provides the `DataBindingComplete` event which occurs when the associated DataGrid `ItemsSource` has been successfully bound to the control, or when any data operation like grouping, sorting, or filtering is applied. The `DataBindingComplete` event handler receives the following parameters:

* The `sender` argument, which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadDataGrid` type.
* A `DataBindingCompleteEventArgs` object, which provides the `DataView` (`IDataViewCollection`) property and allows for traversing and/or manipulating the already computed data view.

## Modifying the Selection

The DataGrid delivers the `SelectionChanged` event which is triggered whenever the `SelectedItems` collection is changed. The `SelectionChanged` event handler receives the following parameters:
* The `sender` argument, which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadDataGrid` type.
* A `DataGridSelectionChangedEventArgs` object, which provides the following properties:
	- `RemovedItems`&mdash;Gets a list of the removed items from the `SelectedItems` collection.
	- `AddedItems`&mdash;Gets a list of the added items to the `SelectedItems` collection.

For more information, see the article about the [`SelectionChanged` event of the .NET MAUI DataGrid]({%slug datagrid-selection-overview%}).

## Changing the Current Cell

The DataGrid also supports the `CurrentCellChanged` event which is invoked when the current cell changes. The `CurrentCellChanged` event handler receives the following parameters:

* The `sender` argument, which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadDataGrid` type.
* A `CurrentCellChangedEventArgs` object, which provides the following properties:
	- `OldCurrentCell`&mdash;Gets the previously `CurrentCell`.
	- `NewCurrentCell`&mdash;Gets the new `CurrentCell`.

For more information, see the article about the [`CurrentCellChanged` event in the .NET MAUI DataGrid]({%slug datagrid-current-cell%}).

## Reordering the Column

The DataGrid exposes the `ColumnReorderStarting`, `ColumnReordering`, `ColumnReorderCompleting`, and `ColumnReordered` events related to the column reordering operation. For more details, review the DataGrid [Columns Reordering]({%slug datagrid-columns-reordering%}#events) article. 

## Resizing the Column

The DataGrid resizing feature exposes a `ColumnUserResizeCompleted` event which is invoked when a column is resized by user interaction. The `ColumnUserResizeCompleted` event handler receives the following parameters:
* The `sender` argument, which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadDataGrid` type.
* A `ColumnUserResizeCompletedEventArgs` object, which provides the following properties:
	- `Column` (`DataGridColumn`)&mdash;Gets the previously `CurrentCell`.
	- `Width` (`double`)&mdash;Gets the width of the column that is resized.
