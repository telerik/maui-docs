# Expand and Collapse Groups in .NET MAUI DataGrid

The [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI DataGrid]({%slug datagrid-overview%}) supports group expand and collapse operations either through the UI by tapping on the group headers, or programmatically. 

The DataGrid allows you to collapse all groups by setting the `AutoExpandGroups` (`bool`) property. The default value is `false`, which means, all groups are expanded.

This section provides an overview of the methods and commands used to control the expand/collapse state of the DataGrid groups.

## Get the Grouped DataGrid Items

To manipulate the collapsible DataGrid groups, first you will need to call its `GetDataView` method. In short, the `GetDataView` method provides a view of the `ItemsSource` after all the sorting, grouping, and filtering operations are applied. The return type is `IDataViewCollection` which exposes the `expand` and `collapse` methods described in the following sections.

```C#
var dataView = this.dataGrid.GetDataView();
```

## Expand and Collapse All Groups

To expand all groups, use the `ExpandAll` method and, respectively, the `CollapseAll` method to collapse all groups.

```C#
//expand all
var dataView = this.dataGrid.GetDataView();
dataView.ExpandAll();

//collapse all
var dataView = this.dataGrid.GetDataView();
dataView.CollapseAll();
```

## Expand and Collapse Specific Groups

You can retrieve the first-level groups through the `GetGroups` method of the `IDataViewCollection` object and use `ExpandGroup`/`CollapseGroup` to make a certain group to expand or collapse respectively. You can check whether a group is expanded trough the `GetIsExpanded` method.

The following example demonstrates how these methods are used:

```C#
var dataView = this.dataGrid.GetDataView();
var rootGroups = dataView.GetGroups();

var isFirstExpanded = dataView.GetIsExpanded(rootGroups.First());
//expand a certain group
dataView.ExpandGroup(rootGroups.First());
//collapse a certain group
dataView.CollapseGroup(rootGroups.First());
```

Additionally, `IDataViewCollection` provides the `ExpandItem`/`CollapseItem` methods that take a data item as a parameter and expand/collapse the immediate group containing this item.

```C#
var lastItem = (dataGrid.ItemsSource as IEnumerable<City>).Last();
var dataView = this.dataGrid.GetDataView();
dataView.CollapseItem(lastItem);
```
