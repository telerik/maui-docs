# .NET MAUI AutoComplete Localization

The `RadAutoComplete` component provides language localization. This allows you to translate the phrases used across the AutoComplete control to other languages so that you can adapt your app to different regions.

> To learn in details about the localization process of the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI components, see the [Localization and Globalization]({%slug globalization-localization%}) topic.

In `RadAutoComplete`, you can localize the following string:

| Localization Key | Default Value |
| -----------------| ------------- |
| `AutoComplete_NoResultsMessage` | `Not Found.` |
