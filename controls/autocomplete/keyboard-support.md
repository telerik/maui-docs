# .NET MAUI AutoComplete Keyboard Support

The [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI AutoComplete]({%slug autocomplete-overview%}) provides keyboard navigation support on `WinUI` and `MacCatalyst`.

The following table lists the actions and keyboard combinations that are available in the AutoComplete:

| Hotkey Combinations  | Action |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| `Up Arrow` / `Down Arrow` | When the suggestion vie is opened, pressing Up/Down Arrows will change the highlighted item in the suggestion view list. |
| `Left Arrow` / `Right Arrow` | Pressing Left/Right Arrows will change the cursor position of the AutoComplete control. |
| `Enter` | Commits the selected item from the suggestion view and closes the suggestion view. |
| `Esc`	| Takes effect only when the suggestion view is opened. It closes the suggestion view of the AutoComplete. |
| `Home` / `End` | Works only when `IsEditable` is `False`. When the suggestion view is opened pressing the Home/End keys will change the highlighted item to the first/last item. |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | When the suggestion view is opened pressing PageUp/PageDown will change the highlighted item. |
| `Tab` | Focuses the control and opens the suggestion view. |
