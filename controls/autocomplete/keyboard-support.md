# .NET MAUI AutoComplete Keyboard Support

[Telerik UI for .NET MAUI AutoComplete]({%slug autocomplete-overview%}) provides keyboard navigation support on WinUI and Mac Catalyst.

The following table lists the actions and keyboard combinations that are available in the AutoComplete control:

| Hotkey Combinations  | Action |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| `Tab` | Focuses the control and opens the suggestion view. |
| `Enter` | Commits the selected item from the suggestion view and closes the suggestion view. |
| `Esc`	| Takes effect only when the suggestion view is opened. It closes the suggestion view of the AutoComplete control. |
| `Up Arrow` / `Down Arrow` | When the suggestion view is opened, pressing `Up/Down Arrows` changes the highlighted item in the suggestion view list. |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | When the suggestion view is opened, pressing `PageUp/PageDown` changes the highlighted item. `PageUp` navigates to the first item in the visible area, `PageDown` navigates to the last item in the visible area. |
