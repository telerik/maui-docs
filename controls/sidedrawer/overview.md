# .NET MAUI SideDrawer Overview

Telerik UI for .NET MAUI SideDrawer is designed to enable users to visualize a hidden view in their applications. That view can host navigation UI, common settings or any other UI of your choice. It can be visualized using a flick gesture on mobile or custom UI which has to manipulate the `IsOpen` property on Desktop. In addition, the developer of the application can set the exact position the drawer will be visualized.

## Key Features

* [Drawer positions]({%slug sidedrawer-features-configuration%})&mdash;Display the drawer from any of the four edges of the screen. You can define its position through the `DrawerLocation` property.
