# .NET MAUI SideDrawer Overview

Telerik UI for .NET MAUI SideDrawer is designed to enable users to visualize a hidden view in their applications. That view can host navigation UI, common settings or any other UI of your choice. It can be visualized using a flick gesture on mobile or custom UI which has to manipulate the `IsOpen` property on Desktop. In addition, the developer of the application can set the exact position the drawer will be visualized.

## Key Features of the .NET MAUI SideDrawer

* [Drawer positions]({%slug sidedrawer-features-configuration%})&mdash;Display the drawer from any of the four edges of the screen. You can define its position through the `DrawerLocation` property.

* [Effects and transitions]({%slug sidedrawer-features-transitions%})&mdash;SideDrawer supports transition animations that are applied to the opening and closing view. There are predefined animations that can be set or changed at runtime to meet our customersâ€™ requirements.

* [Commands support]({%slug sidedrawer-features-commands%})&mdash;SideDrawer allows you to attach commands that will be executed when opening, closing the drawer.
