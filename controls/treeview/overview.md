# .NET MAUI TreeView Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI TreeView represents hierarchical data in a tree like structure. It supports manipulation of its tree nodes, such as expand and collapse, provides selection, checkboxes, flexible styling API, commands support, and more.

To populate the TreeView, you can use any data source that is hierarchical in nature.

## Key Features

* Hierarchical Navigation&mdash;TreeView improves the navigation and performance of your application where navigation over hierarchical structure is required.
* [Expand/Collapse items]({%slug treeview-expand-collapse%})&mdash;The control introduces methods which can be used to programmatically expand/collapse all items. 
* [Commands]({%slug treeview-commands%})&mdash;TreeView provides commands for expanding, collapsing, checking, and unchecking the items. 
* [Checkbox Support]({%slug treeview-checkboxes%})&mdash;Telerik `RadTreeView` provides checkbox buttons displayed next to each item. The `RadTreeView` allows the user to check/uncheck the nodes and to perform various tasks with the collection of checked nodes. The three states checkbox mode of the `RadTreeView` control allows the  `RadTreeViewItems`' checkboxes to have an additional, third state&mdash;Indeterminate.
* [Data Binding]({%slug treeview-getting-started%})&mdash;Simply setting the collection of custom business objects as an `ItemsSource` in combination with a `TreeViewDescriptor` class is enough to visualize the hierarchically-structured source.
* UI Virtualization&mdash;The user interface uses virtualization to display the required elements, meaning that they are created only when needed and only for the currently visible cells.
* [Different selection]({%slug treeview-selection%})&mdash;The .NET MAUI TreeView supports both single and multiple selection. In addition, you can disable the selection. 
* [Vertical scrolling]({%slug treeview-scrolling%})&mdash;Scroll through the items vertically and use the option to scroll to a concrete item. 
* [Style properties]({%slug treeview-item-style%})&mdash;The available styling properties allow you to customize the items. To take advantage of the conditional styling feature provided by the TreeView, you can use the [style selector]({%slug treeview-itemstyle-selector%}).
* Empty template&mdash;Set an empty template if the default one does not fit in the scenario you have.
