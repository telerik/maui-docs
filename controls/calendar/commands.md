# .NET MAUI Calendar Commands

The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/maui-ui/calendar" target="_blank">.NET MAUI Calendar</a> provides various commands that allow the user to switch between the display modes and views.

## Commands for Navigating the Current View

The following commands enable the navigation between same level views:

* `NavigateToNextViewCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Gets the command that is executed when the user navigates to the next view.
* `NavigateToPreviousViewCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Gets the command that is executed when the user navigates to the previous view.

## Commands for Navigating between Views

The following commands enable the navigation between the view levels: 

* `NavigateToUpperViewCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Gets the command that is executed when the user navigates to the upper view.
* `NavigateToLowerViewCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Gets the command that is executed when the user navigates to the lower view..

When switching between view levels, the Calendar implements the following navigation sequence:

* When navigating to the upper view: Month > Year > Decade > Century.
* When navigating to the lower view: Century > Decade > Year > Month.
