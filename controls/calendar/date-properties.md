# .NET MAUI Calendar Date Properties

The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/maui-ui/calendar" target="_blank">.NET MAUI Calendar</a> provides various date properties that allow you to configure the control by setting the display date, restricting the selectable dates, disabling the day names, and more.

## Setting the Display Date

To set the currently displayed date, use the `DisplayDate` property.

* `DisplayDate`(`DateTime`)&mdash;Specifies the date that is currently displayed.

## Constraining Visible Dates and Selection

To limit the visible dates in the Calendar that the user can select, use the `MinDate` and `MaxDate` properties. This allows you to prevent the user from navigating the Calendar to a date outside of the defined date range.

As a result, if the currently selected view contains any dates that are outside of the defined `MinDate`-`MaxDate` range, they look disabled.

* `MinDate`(`DateTime`)&mdash;Specifies the earliest date that the Calendar can display.
* `MaxDate`(`DateTime`)&mdash;Specifies the latest date that the Calendar can display.

## Hiding the Names of the Days

In the Month view, the names of the days of the week are visible by default. You can hide the names by setting the `AreDayNamesVisible`(`bool`) property to `False`.

## Hiding the Leading and Trailing Days

## Setting the First Day of the Week

For half of the world, Monday is the first day of the week, and for the other half, this is Sunday. Use the `FirstDayOfWeek` property to set the first day of the week in your application.

 * `FirstDayOfWeek`(enum of type ` System.DayOfWeek?`)&mdash;Specifies the day that is considered the beginning of the week.
