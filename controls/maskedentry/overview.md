## Key Features

* [Mask types]({%slug maskedentry-masked-types%})&mdash;The MaskedEntry allows you to define a string of characters that constrain user input. The `Mask` property may contain literals and special mask characters based on the used MaskedEntry such as Regex, Numeric, and more.

* [Value property]({%slug maskedentry-value%})&mdash;The MaskedEntry returns the user input without the formatting characters.

* [Null Values support]({%slug maskedentry-value%}#null-value-support)&mdash;The MaskedEntry provides support for null values.

* [Validation UI]({%slug maskedentry-validation%})&mdash;If the user is entering a value not matching the mask requirements, the MaskedEntry will display an error message, which you can customize.

* [Prompt Character]({%slug maskedentry-prompt-character%})&mdash;The MaskedEntry enables you to display a prompt character for any mask position which is not yet filled in by the user.

* [Exhaustive number of events]({%slug maskedentry-events%})&mdash;You can use the events exposed by the MaskedEntry to execute various operations on user interaction such as value changing.

* Keyboard support&mdash;The MaskedEntry supports arrow-key keyboard navigation for implementing various commands in your desktop application.

* Option to define different [keyboard type]({%slug maskedentry-keyboard%}) on specific MaskedEntry.

* [Flexible styling API]({%slug maskedentry-styling%})for changing the clear button color, background color of the input and background color of the control.

* [Globalization support]({%slug maskedentry-globalization%})&mdash;The MaskedEntry allows you to develop your application in such a way that it works about the target device culture.

* [Localization support]({%slug maskedentry-localization%})&mdash;Translate the text displayed as a validation error message to other languages when the device culture is changed.
