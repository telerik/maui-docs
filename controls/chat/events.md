# .NET MAUI Chat Events

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Chat allows you to attach events that will be raised when certain actions occur.

Here is a list of the available events:

* `SendMessage`&mdash;Raised when a message is sent from the chat by the current author (by clicking the send message button or pressing Enter).
* `AttachFiles`&mdash;Raised when the end user picks files to attach.
* `RemoveAttachedFile`&mdash;Raised when the end user removes an attached file, via the `X` button of the `ChatInputAreaAttachedFileItemView`.
