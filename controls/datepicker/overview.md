## Key Features of the .NET MAUI DatePicker

* [Spinner format]({%slug datepicker-formatting%}#setting-the-spinner-format)&mdash;The DatePicker for .NET MAUI allows you to use a standard or custom date format string through its `SpinnerFormat` property. Depending on the type of format, the picker visualizes spinner controls with the pre-populated values.
