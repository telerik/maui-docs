# .NET MAUI TimePicker Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI TimePicker provides a convenient way for users to select a time and visualizes its items inside a popup or a dropdown.

The TimePicker provides a number of features which allow you to set a time range, time format, and to customize the dialog/dropdown appearance, for example, its header and footer.

## Key Features of the .NET MAUI TimePicker

* [Time ranges]({%slug timepicker-time-range%})&mdash;The TimePicker allows you to define a time range by setting minimum and maximum time values and enables users to choose a time within that range.

* [`TimeOnly` Support]({%slug timepicker-timeonly%})&mdash;The TimePicker provides support for the TimeOnly type by using a converter.

* [Spinner format]({%slug timepicker-formatting%}#spinner-format)&mdash;The TimePicker for .NET MAUI allows you to use a standard or a custom time format string through the `TimePicker.SpinnerFormat` property. Depending on the types of the format that is set, the picker visualizes spinner controls with pre-populated values that can be picked.

* [Picker mode]({%slug timepicker-picker-mode%})&mdash;You can choose between `Popup` and `DropDown` UI for showing the spinner controls with the available time values. For Desktop the default picker mode is `DropDown` while for mobile it's `Popup`.

* [Display String format]({%slug timepicker-formatting%}#displaystring-format)&mdash;You can choose what text to be displayed when a time value is selected by using the `DisplayStringFormat` TimePicker property.

* [Time selection]({%slug timepicker-selection%})&mdash;You can set a current selected time or a default highlighted time to the TimePicker.

* [Time steps]({%slug timepicker-time-steps%})&mdash;You can also change the default time-value steps to an hour, a minute, and a second.

* [Templates]({%slug timepicker-templates%})&mdash;The TimePicker provides templates for its header and footer. Also, it exposes templates for its placeholder and display text.

* [Flexible styling API]({%slug timepicker-styling%})&mdash;Take advantage of the styling capabilities of the TimePicker control. You can style its spinners, the popup and its header and footer, the text displayed after a time is selected, and so on.

* [Commands support]({%slug timepicker-commands%})&mdash;The TimePicker exposes the `Clear Command` command that allows you to clear the selected time and the `Toggle Command` that allows you to open and close the dialog.
