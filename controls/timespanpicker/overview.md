# .NET MAUI TimeSpanPicker Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI TimeSpanPicker provides an easy way to select a time duration. The control represents a time interval and allows you to set a time range between two time intervals, which can be measured in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The flexible styling API gives you the opportunity to fully customize the dialog/dropdown appearance, for example, its header and footer.

## Key Features

* [Spinner Format]({%slug timespanpicker-formatting%})&mdash;The TimeSpanPicker for .NET MAUI allows you to use standard or custom time span format string through its `TimeSpanPicker.SpinnerFormat` property. Depending on what format is set, the picker visualizes spinner controls with pre-populated values that can be picked.

* [Display String format]({%slug timespanpicker-formatting%})&mdash;You can choose what text to be displayed when a time interval is selected using the TimeSpanPicker `DisplayStringFormat` property.

* [Picker mode]({%slug timespanpicker-picker-mode%})&mdash;You can choose between `Popup` and `DropDown` UI for showing the spinner controls with the available time values. For Desktop the default picker mode is `DropDown` while for mobile it's `Popup`.

* [Templates]({%slug timespanpicker-templates%})&mdash;The TimeSpanPicker provides templates for its header and footer. Also, the control exposes templates for its placeholder and display text.

* [Time range]({%slug timespanpicker-timespan-range%})&mdash;The TimeSpanPicker allows you to define a time range by setting minimum and maximum time values and enables users to choose a time within that range.

* [Time interval selection]({%slug timespanpicker-selection%})&mdash;You can set a currently selected time interval to the TimeSpanPicker or define a default highlighted time interval.

* [Incremental time steps]({%slug timespanpicker-timespan-steps%})&mdash;You can also change the default time interval steps to days, hours, minutes, or seconds.

* [Flexible styling API]({%slug timespanpicker-styling%})&mdash;Take advantage of the styling capabilities of the TimeSpanPicker control. You can style its spinners, the popup and its header and footer, the text displayed after a time interval is selected, and many more.

* [Commands support]({%slug timespanpicker-commands%})&mdash;The TimeSpanPicker exposes the `ClearCommand` that allows you to clear the selected time interval and the `ToggleCommand` that allows you to open and close the dialog.
* Localization support&mdash;Translate the used across the TimeSpanPicker texts to other languages, so that your app can be adapted to different regions.
