# .NET MAUI CheckBox Overview

**Telerik RadCheckBox for .NET MAUI** is a checkbox control, which enables users to make a choice between two mutually exclusive options. The user selection is indicated by a check mark, and when a user clicks the checkbox, its appearance and state change.  

> The CheckBox follows the rendering guidelines of the operating system. As a result, on iOS its visualized as a circle while `Android` and `WinUI` display it as a square.
