# .NET MAUI ListView Commands

The Command design-pattern is used in the XAML and MVVM world. The ListView strictly follows the Command design-pattern best practices and provides an intuitive and easy-to-use set of APIs that allow you to control various aspects of ListView behavior.

The ListView exposes a `Commands` collection that allows you to register custom commands with each controlâ€™s instance through the `RadListView.Commands` property. `Commands` gets the collection with all the custom commands registered with the `CommandService`. Custom commands have higher priority than the built-in (default) ones.

## Command ID Enumeration

All predefined commands within a `RadListView` instance are identified by a member of the `CommandId` enumeration. This member is the key that relates a command instance to a particular action/routine within the owning ListView.

To register a custom command within a `RadListView` instance you can:

* [Inherit from the ListView Command class](#inheriting-from-listviewcommand) and override its `CanExecute` and `Execute` methods.
* [Use the ListView User Command class and bind its Command property](#binding-listviewusercommand) to a `Command` in your `ViewModel`.

In both cases, you need to set the `Id` property of the new command so that it can be properly associated with the desired action/event.

Each command has a `context` object of type `[CommandId]CommandContext`. The available commands and their context are described in the table below:

| Commands | Object type |
| -------- | ---------- |
| `ItemTap` | `ItemTapCommandContext` |
| `ItemHold` | `ItemHoldCommandContext` |
| `ItemSwiping` | `ItemSwipingCommandContext` |
| `ItemSwipeStarting` | `ItemSwipeStartingCommandContext` |
| `ItemSwipeCompleted` | `ItemSwipeCompletedCommandContext` |
| `PullToRefreshRequested` | `PullToRefreshRequestedCommandContext` |
| `SelectionChanged` | `SelectionChangedCommandContext` |
| `LoadOnDemand` | `LoadOnDemandCommandContext` |
| `GroupHeaderTap` | `GroupHeaderContext` |
| `ReorderStarting` | `ReorderStartingCommandContext` |
| `ReorderEnded` | `ReorderEndedCommandContext` |

>tip Commands action correspond to the events exposed by the ListView. For more details, see the [Events]({%slug listview-features-events%}) topic.

 The `context` object is passed as a parameter in its `Execute` method and provides information identical to the corresponding event arguments.

 >important When overriding the `ReorderEnded` and `GroupHeaderTap` commands you have to implement the action each command does. For example, manually reorder items and manually update the group `IsExpanded` state. 

## Inheriting from ListViewCommand

To demonstrate inheriting from the `ListViewCommand`, the following example handles the `ItemTap` action as a Command:

**1.** Create a class that inherits from the `ListViewCommand` and set its `Id` property. Then override the `CanExecute` and `Execute` methods:

<snippet id='listview-features-commands-listviewcommand'/>

**2.**. Add the custom command to the Commands collection of the `RadListView` instance:

<snippet id='listview-features-commands-add'/>

## Binding ListViewUserCommand

With the `ListViewUserCommand` binding approach, you can directly handle the custom commands in the `ViewModel`.

**1.**. Add the custom command to the `ViewModel`:

<snippet id='listview-features-commands-viewmodel'/>

**2.** Bind the `ItemTapCommand` through the predefined `ListViewUserCommand` command. Its `Id` property is used to map the command to the corresponding action with the control:

<snippet id='listview-commands-listviewusercommand-xaml'/>
