# Earlier Versions Support Policy in UI for .NET MAUI

This article provides information about the support provided for earlier Telerik UI for .NET MAUI versions.

The support policy includes the way bug fixes, feature enhancements, and browser compatibility are updated and applied across the Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for .NET MAUI suite.

* [Bug Fixes](#bug-fixes)
* [New Features and Components](#new-features-and-components)
* [Implementation Support](#implementation-support)

>note For best performance results, use the latest UI for .NET MAUI version which contains all recent features and fixes that are available. Telerik supports only the latest available version of UI for .NET MAUI.

## Bug Fixes

Bugs in UI for .NET MAUI components are fixed depending on the priority set by the product management and based on the [public Feedback portal](https://feedback.telerik.com/maui), [support system](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets), surveys, interviews, and other means at management discretion.

Bug fixes are then implemented in the product by the Development team and later introduced in the first [official product release](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/maui-ui/release-history).

To get a bug fix, you have to [upgrade]({%slug upgrade-tutorial%}) your project to the release that contains the fix, or later.

For bugs in earlier versions, you may receive a technically feasible workaround through the ticketing system. However, Progress Software Corporation cannot guarantee that bug fixes for earlier versions will become available and cannot provide any warranty on the provided workarounds.

## New Features and Components

Feature enhancements and new components become publicly available in the first major release following their implementation by the Development team.

New features and components will not be made retroactively available for versions earlier than the version in which they were introduced.

## Implementation Support

For earlier versions, you can get suggestions on how to implement certain scenarios, features, and UI for .NET MAUI tools in your project in the ticketing system and depending on their technical feasibility. If such an implementation relies on the API, fixes, or enhancements that are implemented in later versions, you will need to upgrade to a release which contains the required feature.
