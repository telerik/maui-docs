You can get the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI assemblies in two ways:

* After installing the controls by [using the MSI installer]({%slug automated-installer%})&mdash;By default, once you complete the installation, the assemblies will be located in the `C:\Program Files\Progress\Binaries` (for 32-bit machines) or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Binaries` (for 64-bit machines) folder.
* By downloading the [ZIP archive]({%slug zip-archive%}) with the controls&mdash;Look for the `Binaries` folder in the archive.
