# License Activation Errors and Warnings

Starting with the 2025 Q1 release, using Telerik UI for .NET MAUI without a license or with an invalid license causes specific license warnings and errors. This article defines what an invalid license is, explains what is causing it, and describes the related license warnings and errors.

## Invalid License

An invalid license can be caused by any of the following:

- Using an expired subscription licenseâ€”subscription licenses expire at the end of the subscription term.
- Using a perpetual license for product versions released outside the validity period of your license.
- Using an expired trial license.
- A missing license for Telerik UI for .NET MAUI.
- Not installing a license key in your application.
- Not updating the license key after renewing your Telerik UI for .NET MAUI license.

## License Warnings and Errors

When using Telerik UI for .NET MAUI in a project with an expired or missing license, the `Telerik.Licensing` build task will indicate the following errors:

| Error or Condition                              | Message Code | Solution                                                              |

| `Corrupted Telerik and Kendo UI License Key content` | TKL003 | [Download a new license key]({%slug set-up-your-license%}#downloading-the-license-key) and use it to activate the UI controls and remove the error message. |
| `Unable to locate licenses for all products` | TKL004 | Your license is not valid for all Telerik and Kendo products added to your project. If you have already purchased the required license, then [update your license key]({%slug set-up-your-license%}#updating-your-license-key). |

|                                        | | - Downgrade to a product version included in your perpetual license as indicated in the message. |

If you do not use Telerik products, remove the `Telerik.Licensing` NuGet reference from your project. |
