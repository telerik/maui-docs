# Starting a Trial

Starting a Telerik UI for .NET MAUI trial gives you full access to all Telerik .NET MAUI components and their functionality. In addition, you get free technical support for 30 days.

>The MAUI installer activates your free trial period once you reach the last installation step. It also automatically downloads the [license key file]({%slug set-up-your-license%}) used to activate the MAUI controls.

To start your Telerik UI for .NET MAUI trial:

1. Go to the [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI product page](https://www.telerik.com/maui-ui).
