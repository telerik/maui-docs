## Description

When I install the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI NuGet package, I get the following error:

`Unable to find package Telerik.UI.for.Maui. No packages exist with this id in source(s): nuget.org` 

## Cause

The error `Unable to find package in source` indicates that the NuGet package manager searches for the Telerik NuGet package in the wrong package source.

The possible causes are:
* The Telerik NuGet source configuration is missing in the `NuGet.Config` file.
* The NuGet package manager uses an incorrect `NuGet.Config` file. The file may be misplaced or contain incorrect information.

## Solution

1. Inspect the `NuGet.Config` file used by the NuGet package manager.
1. Update the file by following the guidelines for [configuring a NuGet source by using the `NuGet.Config` file]({%slug nuget-config%}).
