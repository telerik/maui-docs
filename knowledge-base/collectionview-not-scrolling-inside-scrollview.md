## Description

When using `RadCollectionView` inside a ScrollView in a .NET MAUI application, the `RadCollectionView` does not scroll during item drag or swipe actions. 

## Cause

Nesting scrollable controls, such as `RadCollectionView`, within a ScrollView is discouraged as it breaks UI virtualization and leads to various issues. This is documented in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/scrollview?view=net-maui-9.0), which advises against nesting ScrollView objects with other controls that provide their own scrolling functionality.

## Solution

To resolve the scrolling issue with `RadCollectionView` when it's placed inside a ScrollView, consider the following approaches:
* [Remove the ScrollView](#approach-1-remove-the-scrollview)
* [Set a Definitive Height](#approach-2-set-a-definitive-height)

### Approach 1: Remove the ScrollView

Eliminate the ScrollView from your layout. This allows `RadCollectionView` to manage its own scrolling behavior effectively without interference.

### Approach 2: Set a Definitive Height

Assign a definitive height to `RadCollectionView` or any control that has internal scrolling. This adjustment helps in defining the control's scrollable area explicitly, thereby preventing conflicts with the ScrollView.

By applying one of these solutions, `RadCollectionView` will scroll as expected when it is used within a ScrollView in a .NET MAUI application.
