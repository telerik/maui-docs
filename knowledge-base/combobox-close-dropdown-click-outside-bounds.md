## Environment

| Product | Version |
|---------|---------|
| ComboBox for .NET MAUI | 6.6.0 |

## Description

To close the DropDown of the ComboBox when the user clicks outside of the component's bounds, you can use a workaround that involves attaching a gesture recognizer to the parent layout or main layout in the page and setting the `IsDropDownOpen` property of the ComboBox to `false`.

## Solution

Follow these steps to implement the workaround:

**1.** In your XAML code, locate the parent layout or main layout that contains the ComboBox.
**2.** Add a `GestureRecognizer` to the parent layout and subscribe to its `Tapped` event. For example:

```XAML
<VerticalStackLayout>
    <VerticalStackLayout.GestureRecognizers>
        <TapGestureRecognizer Tapped="TapGestureRecognizer_Tapped"/>
    </VerticalStackLayout.GestureRecognizers>
    <!-- Other controls and elements -->
</VerticalStackLayout>
```

**3.** In the event handler method, set the `IsDropDownOpen` property of the ComboBox to `false`. This will close the DropDown when someone clicks outside its boundaries. For example:

```C#
private void TapGestureRecognizer_Tapped(object sender, TappedEventArgs e)
{
    this.comboBox.IsDropDownOpen = false;
}
```


## Notes

- This workaround is applicable to both Android and iOS platforms.
- Make sure to replace `comboBox` with the actual name of your ComboBox control in the event handler method.
