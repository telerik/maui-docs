> Telerik UI for .NET MAUI version 12.0.0 adds support for .NET 10.0. You can easily switch the .NET version to .NET 9.0 or .NET 10 to build the apps. 
> Inside the Examples folder of the installation/.zip file there are `.ps1` files - `SwitchToNet8.ps1` and `SwitchToNet9.ps1`. You can use them to switch the .NET version you use to build the .NET MAUI sample apps.

## .NET MAUI Controls Samples App

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Controls Samples is a highly polished application offering many scenario-specific use cases designed to show off a subset of features for each component. The app provides various .NET MAUI examples for many of the 60+ .NET MAUI controls included in the library.

For more information on it, refer to [Controls Samples App]({%slug controls-samples-app%}).

## .NET MAUI SDKBrowser App Examples

The SDKBrowser is a set of .NET MAUI samples in C# and XAML that explain how to use the features of a control. Contrary to the Controls Samples application, the SDKBrowser shows the components in their pure form without adding extra styling and polishing. It's the go-to source for "how do I use X in Y control". Most of the code snippets available in the documentation are directly generated from the examples in the SDKBrowser (you can see special comments in the code for this).
